图表调用dig挖掘

图表调用简单，不做排序，流量显示为KB/MB/GB

Order By URL Bandwidth

目前测试图表调用有问题



BOWANG发来的测试语句
1.从$log-traffic中取数据
select srcip,hostname,sum(coalesce(sentbyte, 0)+coalesce(rcvdbyte, 0)) as traffic from $log-webfilter where hostname notnull group by srcip,hostname order by traffic desc


2.
select c.srcip,c.website,c.bandwidth from (select
g.srcip,g.website,g.bandwidth,row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY g.srcip ORDER BY g.bandwidth desc) rank from ###(select  srcip,hostname as website,sum(coalesce(sentbyte, 0)+coalesce(rcvdbyte, 0)) as bandwidth from $log-webfilter  group by srcip,website order by bandwidth desc )###g)c where c.rank=1 group by c.srcip,c.website,c.bandwidth order by bandwidth desc


3.
select  srcip,hostname as website,sum(coalesce(sentbyte, 0)+coalesce(rcvdbyte, 0)) as traffic from $log-webfilter  group by srcip,website order by traffic desc





4.
select src,website,tfc from ###(select coalesce(nullifna(`user`),ipstr(`t1.srcip`)) as src,t2.hostname as website,sum(t1.sentbyte+t1.rcvdbyte) as tfc from $log-traffic t1 INNER JOIN $log-app-ctrl t2 ON t1.sessionid=t2.sessionid group by src,website order by tfc desc)### t group by src,website,tfc order by tfc desc


以下是一开始的时候，手动写的按照用户排名的select语句，仅做参考
select 
from_itime(itime) as timestamp,
coalesce(nullifna(`user`),nullifna(`unauthuser`),ipstr(`srcip`)) as user_src,
sum(coalesce(`rcvdbyte`,0)+coalesce(`sentbyte`,0)) as bandwidth,
    (select app from $log where coalesce(nullifna(`user`),nullifna(`unauthuser`),ipstr(`srcip`))=user_src group by app order by sum(coalesce(`rcvdbyte`,0)+coalesce(`sentbyte`,0)) desc limit 1 offset 0) as app01,
   (select sum(coalesce(`rcvdbyte`,0)+coalesce(`sentbyte`,0)) from $log where coalesce(nullifna(`user`),nullifna(`unauthuser`),ipst(`srcip`))=user_src group by app order by sum(coalesce(`rcvdbyte`,0)+coalesce(`sentbyte`,0)) desc limit 1 offset 0) as bandwidth01,
   (select sum(coalesce(`rcvdbyte`,0)) from $log where coalesce(nullifna(`user`),nullifna(`unauthuser`),ipstr(`srcip`))=user_src group by app order by sum(coalesce(`rcvdbyte`,0)+coalesce(`sentbyte`,0)) desc limit 1 offset 0) as inbound01,
    (select sum(coalesce(`sentbyte`,0)) from $log where coalesce(nullifna(`user`),nullifna(`unauthuser`),ipstr(`srcip`))=user_src group by app order by sum(coalesce(`rcvdbyte`,0)+coalesce(`sentbyte`,0)) desc limit 1 offset 0) as outbound01
(......此处省略app02,bandwidth02,inbound02,outbound02----05,总共五个排名)
from $log 
group by user_src order by bandwidth desc
